/**
 *  This graph like data structure can be used to predict the next input values based on the inputs
 *  already seen. Prediction is made by recording the sequences of values entered by clients
 *  to keep track of their overall distribution. Each input value is treated as the successor of all
 *  preceding inputs coming from the same sequence (= same client).
 *
 *  A sequence is an ordered collection of inputs Å•ecorded in the same order as they occurred. Each node
 *  in the structure is a associated with exactly one distinct set of values. A node can have multiple
 *  outgoing and incoming edges. More precisely: A node may have as many
 *   a.) outgoing edges as there are distinct supersets with a cardinal value of +1 of the nodes value
 *   b.) incoming edges as there are distinct subsets with a cardinal value of -1 of the nodes value
 *
 *  Each node has a counter representing the number of visits made to that node. Each edge has a counter
 *  used to count the number of traverses.
